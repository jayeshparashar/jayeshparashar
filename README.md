In past 24 years, I have worked  across the globe for various Insurance and Financial services clients,  I strongly believe that we must understand fundamentals and research all the core aspects before building up something big, I started with Quantum Computing almost 10 years ago as hobby and now I am ready to do more as a professional. I love to contribute by making complex concepts easier and simple to understand. Let’s keep it simple.
